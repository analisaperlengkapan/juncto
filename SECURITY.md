## Reporting security issues

We take security very seriously and develop all Juncto projects to be secure and safe.

If you find (or simply suspect) a security issue in any of the Juncto projects, please report it to us via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/Juncto-bounty) or send us an email to security@juncto.org. 

**We encourage responsible disclosure for the sake of our users, so please reach out before posting in a public space.**
